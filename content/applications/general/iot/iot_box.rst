IoT box
=======

To start using an IoT box:

#. Make sure you have a valid IoT box subscription in addition to your Odoo subscription.
#. Connect your :doc:`devices <devices>` to the IoT box.
#. :ref:`Connect the IoT box <iot/iot_box/network>` to the network.
#. :doc:`Connect the IoT box to your Odoo database <connect>`.

.. note::
   Devices can also be connected after the IoT box is added to the network and/or connected to the
   database; however, a reboot of the IoT box is required.

.. _iot/iot_box/network:

Network connection
==================

The IoT box can be connected to the network via :ref:`Ethernet <iot/iot_box/network-ethernet>` or
:ref:`Wi-Fi <iot/iot_box/network-wifi>`.

.. important::
   The IoT box must be connected to the same network as the devices connected to Odoo and the ones
   connected to the IoT box.

.. _iot/iot_box/network-ethernet:

Ethernet
--------

Connect the IoT box to a power source, then plug the Ethernet cable into the IoT box's Ethernet port
and an available port on your router.

.. _iot/iot_box/network-wifi:

Wi-Fi
-----

Make sure no Ethernet cable is connected to the IoT box and follow these steps:

  #. Connect the IoT box to a power source and wait a few minutes for it to power on.
  #. Access your computer's Wi-Fi settings and select the IoT box's network. The network name is in
     the format `IoTBox-xxxxxxxxxxxx` (where `xxxxxxxxxxxx` is a unique identifier).
  #. Connect to the IoT box's Wi-Fi network and sign into it; your browser should automatically
     open and redirect to the :ref:`IoT box's homepage <iot/iot-box/homepage>`.

     .. note::
        Depending on your operating system, the browser might not open and redirect to the IoT box's
        homepage. In this case, open your browser manually and navigate to `http://10.11.12.1`.

  #. On the IoT box's homepage, click :guilabel:`Configure` next to the :guilabel:`Internet Status`
     section.
  #. Wait a few minutes for the available networks to be scanned, select the network, enter the
     Wi-Fi's password, and click :guilabel:`Connect`.

.. note::
   Once connected to the Wi-Fi network, the IoT box stops emitting its Wi-Fi signal, and the
   computer should automatically reconnect to its original network. If it does not, reconnect to it
   manually.

.. _iot/iot-box/homepage:

IoT box homepage
================

To access the IoT box's homepage, open a web browser **on the same network as the IoT box** and
navigate to the IoT box's address.

The IoT box's IP address can be retrieved by:

- connecting the IoT box to an external monitor: the IP address is displayed on the screen.

- connecting the IoT box to a printer: the IP address is automatically printed.
- accessing the administrator interface of the router that the IoT box is connected to or using
  third-party software to scan the network.

Once the IoT box is :doc:`connected to the Odoo database <connect>`, its homepage can be accessed
from Odoo by opening the IoT app and clicking the URL displayed on the IoT box's card.
