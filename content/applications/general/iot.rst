========================
Internet of Things (IoT)
========================

Odoo IoT allows to connect physical devices such as barcode scanners, receipt printers, payment
terminals, measurement tools, etc. to an Odoo database using an IoT system.

The following IoT systems are supported:

- :doc:`IoT box <iot/iot_box>`: micro-computer, plug-and-play device (IoT program pre-installed);
- :doc:`Windows virtual IoT <iot/windows_iot>`: Windows program that can be installed on a Windows
  computer.

.. important::
   An IoT box subscription is required to use IoT systems with a secured connection.

.. note::
   - :abbr:`MRP (Material Requirement Planning)` devices, including cameras and measurement tools,
     are not compatible with Windows virtual IoT.
   - You can use multiple IoT systems at the same time.
   - It is also possible to create a Windows Virtual Machine on a MacOS/Linux computer. However,
     this option is not supported by Odoo, and no troubleshooting assistance will be provided.
